<p>Brown Edge Technology has imposed standard reporting requirements on its supply chain regardless of where the components and materials are purchased. Brown Edge Technology has been working closely with the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), and with our customers and other Tier 1 suppliers, to ensure continued consistency in the tools used to establish this process. Requirements are cascaded annually to our supply chain, and Brown Edge Technology intends to do what we can to ensure the components and materials in our products, regardless of where they are assembled or sold, do not contain conflict minerals that have contributed to the armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries.</p>
